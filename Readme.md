## Overview
You are responsible for developing a user preferences page using the Webix
framework (https://webix.com/) & Django framework (https://www.djangoproject.com/) for a web application. The user preferences page
will enable users to customize their settings according to their preferences. Your
objective is to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface using modern web
technologies.

## Requirements
- Preference Categories: Group preferences into categories for easy
navigation:
  - Account Settings: Manage user account details like username, email,
and password.
  - Notification Settings: Control email and push notification preferences,
including frequency.
  - Theme Settings: Customize application theme with options for colors,
fonts, and layout.
  - Privacy Settings: Manage privacy preferences, including profile visibility
and data sharing.
- Responsive Design: Create a responsive user preferences page for desktop,
tablet, and mobile devices, ensuring consistent user experience across
different screen sizes.
- Validation and Error Handling: Implement robust validation and error handling
mechanisms to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error messages
to users when modifying preferences.
- Accessibility: Adhere to accessibility standards, making the page usable for
users with disabilities. Consider support keyboard navigation, screen reader
compatibility, and maintain appropriate contrast ratios.
- Testing: Write unit and functional tests to ensure proper functionality.
