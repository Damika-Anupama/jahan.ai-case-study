## Overview
You are responsible for developing a user preferences page using the frontend framework & Django framework (https://www.djangoproject.com/) for a web application. The user preferences page
will enable users to customize their settings according to their preferences. Your
objective is to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface using modern web
technologies.

## Requirements
- Preference Categories: Group preferences into categories for easy
navigation:
  - Account Settings: Manage user account details like username, email,
and password.
  - Notification Settings: Control email and push notification preferences,
including frequency.
  - Theme Settings: Customize application theme with options for colors,
fonts, and layout.
  - Privacy Settings: Manage privacy preferences, including profile visibility
and data sharing.
- Responsive Design: Create a responsive user preferences page for desktop,
tablet, and mobile devices, ensuring consistent user experience across
different screen sizes.
- Validation and Error Handling: Implement robust validation and error handling
mechanisms to ensure data integrity and provide meaningful error messages
to users when modifying preferences.
- Accessibility: Adhere to accessibility standards, making the page usable for
users with disabilities. Consider support keyboard navigation, screen reader
compatibility, and maintain appropriate contrast ratios.
- Testing: Write unit and functional tests to ensure proper functionality.


## Frontend Deliverables
- A git repo with the code to open (locally )
- A walkthrough (meeting) to walk us through the following (as a discussion)
  - the app
  - how you went about it
  - key features and call outs
  - how you would ensure user acceptance
  - how you would incorporate the back end
  - how you would deploy
  - how you would test

## Backend Deliverables

# User Preferences Management System

The repository contains a full-stack application for user preferences management, divided into NextJS frontend and Django backend. This System allows users to register, log in, and manage account, notification, theme, and privacy settings, with support for dark mode for a seamless user experience.

## Frontend

The frontend is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It includes pages for registration, login, and managing user preferences.

For more details, see the [Frontend README](user_preferences_frontend/README.md).

## Backend

The backend is built with Django, Django REST framework and MySQL. It provides APIs for user registration, login, and managing user preferences. JWT authentication is used for secure access.

For more details, see the [Backend README](user_preferences_backend/README.md).

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Damika-Anupama/jahan.ai-case-study.git
```
### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Python, pip, python virtualenv
- MySQL (or another preferred relational database)
